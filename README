WSGI OpenPGP public key submission system
=========================================

pgpsubmit is a simple WSGI_ application that can be used for collecting
OpenPGP_ public keys on a keyring e.g. for a keysigning party.

.. _WSGI: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/


Dependencies
------------

- `python-gnupg`__
- `GnuPG`__
- A WSGI capable web server (e.g. Apache_ with `mod_wsgi`__).

.. _OpenPGP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy
.. _Apache: http://httpd.apache.org/
__ http://packages.python.org/python-gnupg/
__ http://gnupg.org/
__ http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/


Configuration
-------------

Two WSGI ``environ`` variables must be set:

``GNUPGHOME``
  The GnuPG home directory.  Must be writable by the user running the
  application.  Multiple pgpsubmit instances could be run in parallel,
  each with a different ``GNUPGHOME``.
``PGPSUBMITSOURCEURL``
  URL at which may be found the corresponding source of pgpsubmit,
  pursuant to section 15 of the AGPL.  If you run a modified version of
  pgpsubmit, the source code for that modified version must be available
  at this URL.

A configuration for Apache with mod_wsgi might be::

    <Directory /usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin joe@example.com
        ServerName pgpsubmit.example.com
        DocumentRoot "/usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit"

        WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/home/joe/pgpsubmit/scripts/pgpsubmit.wsgi
        SetEnv GNUPGHOME /usr/home/joe/.pgpsubmit
        SetEnv PGPSUBMITSOURCEURL https://gitorious.org/pgpsubmit
    </VirtualHost>
